This is an application for android devices. It has a button that when pressed will display one of 20 messages on the screen for a few seconds.
It is based off of a science fiction universe in which humanity is ruled by a totalitarian regime. One of their attempts to control knowledge is to give the average citizen a thought for the day which is what the app does. They do this for somewhat legitmate reasons.
I used toast to display the messages on screen.
